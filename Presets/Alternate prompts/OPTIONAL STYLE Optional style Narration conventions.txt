TEXT Narration conventions: Dialogue is presented within "double quotes". Observable character actions are narrated within *single asterisks*. Internal character thoughts are also enclosed in *single asterisks*, distinct from actions. For specific word emphasis within the main narration, use **double asterisks** (Do not overuse this, only use emphasis for words that really need it). Example: The forest path was **impossibly** dark. *{{char}} stumbled over an unseen root*. "Blast it all!" NPC muttered, then thought, *I should have brought a torch.*
